    "# Lab 1: Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective  \n",
    "Get started with Google Colab, Python, and PyTorch. See deep learning in action with TensorFlow playground.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverable\n",
    "For this lab, you will submit a Colab notebook (.ipynb) via Learning Suite.\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading\n",
    "Your notebook will be graded on the following:\n",
    "* 50% Part 1: Completed the 10 PyTorch microtasks\n",
    "* 40% Part 2: Image indicating TensorFlow success\n",
    "* 10% Tidy and legible figures, (for the future make sure to label axes where appropriate)\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of Google Colab\n",
    "Throughout this class, we recommend you use Google's Colaboratory (Colab) for the labs. If you aren't familiar with Colab or IPython notebooks, take some time to look at the tutorials linked below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Colab provides an environment that interacts with IPython notebooks (similar to Jupyter) and utilizes a standardized Python distribution.\n",
    "In addition, Colab provides a GPU we can use for deep learning. We will talk about the advantages of GPU vs CPU training in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you are allowed to do the labs on your own machine, using Jupyter or some other IPython notebook editor, the labs were written and updated for the current Python distribution used by Colab. You may need to do extra troubleshooting to get them working locally. Also, setting up your own GPU for deep learning may be difficult, and training on the CPU may be unbearably slow in later labs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lab Details\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is intended to get you used to IPython notebooks, Colab, and a few basic deep learning principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "As described above, the notebook should do two things: \n",
    "1.    Complete all 10 microtasks\n",
    "2.    Display an image that you generate using the Tensorflow playground\n",
    "\n",
    "For part 1, you will be using the PyTorch documentation to learn how to complete simple tasks. Each task is solvable in one or two lines of code. Links are provided for each microtask to give you a guided introduction to PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "For part 2, you should visit the [TensorFlow playground](http://playground.tensorflow.org/),\n",
    "and play with different settings. Most of it will be unfamiliar,\n",
    "but don't worry – you can't break it!\n",
    "Once you have a working classifier on the spiral dataset, take a screenshot. \n",
    "Then use your Colab notebook to display that image in-line.\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Helpful Links\n",
    "\n",
    "[Google Colab](http://colab.research.google.com/) The site where you will probably be coding the labs\n",

    "This is a quick guided walkthrough of PyTorch tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch is a Python library based on the Torch machine learning framework. While other great deep learning alternatives exist, the labs we use in this course were written exclusively for PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "The main PyTorch data structure is the tensor. A tensor in mathematics is a matrix or vector-like structure with more than 2 dimensions, though PyTorch tensors can have 0 or more dimensions. Tensors are implemented similarly to NumPy arrays, and most of what can be done with NumPy can be done with PyTorch tensors. Complete the microtasks in the cells below to learn basic PyTorch tensor manipulation. We provide links to the documentation for this lab, but you should feel comfortable searching the documentation yourself in later labs."
