# Alternate Labs

The alternate labs have the following changes:

* DL_Lab1.ipynb - replaces part 1 (draw 50 random objects) with a guided walkthrough of the PyTorch microtasks, usually as part of lab 2.
* DL_Lab2.ipynb - removes PyTorch microtasks, since they are in the alternative lab 1.

For students: do NOT use the alternative labs unless they match the versions provided by your professor.
