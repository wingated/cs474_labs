    "# Lab 6: Sequence-to-sequence models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description:\n",
    "For this lab, you will code up the [char-rnn model of Karpathy](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/). This is a recurrent neural network that is trained probabilistically on sequences of characters, and that can then be used to sample new sequences that are like the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab will help you develop several new skills, as well as understand some best practices needed for building large models. In addition, we'll be able to create networks that generate neat text!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverable:\n",
    "- Fill in the code for the RNN (using PyTorch's built-in GRU).\n",
    "- Fill in the training loop\n",
    "- Fill in the evaluation loop. In this loop, rather than using a validation set, you will sample text from the RNN.\n",
    "- Implement your own GRU cell.\n",
    "- Train your RNN on a new domain of text (Star Wars, political speeches, etc. - have fun!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading Standards:\n",
    "- 20% Implementation the RNN\n",
    "- 20% Implementation training loop\n",
    "- 20% Implementation of evaluation loop\n",
    "- 20% Implementation of your own GRU cell\n",
    "- 20% Training of your RNN on a domain of your choice\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips:\n",
    "- Read through all the helper functions, run them, and make sure you understand what they are doing\n",
    "- At each stage, ask yourself: What should the dimensions of this tensor be? Should its data type be float or int? (int is called `long` in PyTorch)\n",
    "- Don't apply a softmax inside the RNN if you are using an nn.CrossEntropyLoss (this module already applies a softmax to its input).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Output:\n",
    "An example of my final samples are shown below (more detail in the\n",
    "final section of this writeup), after 150 passes through the data.\n",
    "Please generate about 15 samples for each dataset.\n",
