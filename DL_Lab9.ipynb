    "# Lab 9: Deep Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build DQN and PPO Deep RL algorithms\n",
    "- Learn the difference between Q Learning and Policy Gradient techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverable\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab you will submit an IPython notebook via Learning Suite. This lab gives you a lot of code, and you should only need to modify two of the cells of this notebook, but you can modify any of the given code if you wish.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep reinforcement learning is difficult. We provide hyperparameters, visualizations, and code for gathering experience, but require you to code up algorithms for training your networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Your networks should be able to demonstrate learning on cartpole within a minute of wall time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand what your the starter code is doing. This will help you with the *TODO* sections. The main code block is similar for the two algorithms with some small yet important differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We provide hyperparameters for you to start with. Feel free to experiment with different values, but these worked for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Print dtypes and shapes** throughout your code to make sure your tensors look the way you expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The DQN algorithm is significantly more unstable than PPO. Even with a correct implementation it may fail to learn every 1/10 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unfortunately visualizing your agent acting in the environment is non-trivial in Colab. You can visualize your agent by running this code locally and uncommenting the `env.render()` line.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "- 35% Part 1: DQN *TODO* methods\n",
    "- 35% Part 2: PPO *TODO* methods\n",
    "- 20% Cartpole learning curves for DQN and PPO\n",
    "- 10% Tidy legible code\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cartpole\n",
    "\n",
    "Cartpole is a simple environment to get your agent up and running. It has a continuous state space of 4 dimensions and a discrete action space of 2. The agent is given a reward of 1 for each timestep it remains standing. Your agent should be able to reach close to 200 cumulative reward for an episode after a minute or two of training. The below graphs show example results for dqn (left) and ppo (right).\n",
